  * countToBy(17,3); count to 17 by 3s 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17

  * counting to 25 by 4s. The count must always end at n, but notice 
  * that it will not always be possible to start counting at 1, 
  * as shown in the output when n is 30 and m is 4. But the first 
  * number should always be in the range of 1 to m inclusive. 
  * It is possible that only one number will be printed, as shown in 
  * the output when n is 3 and m is 6.
